## 4.14

- Published: 2026-09-09T18:24:42Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.14

AdGuard for Android v4.14 is focused on improving compatibility and making ad blocking work seamlessly with the privacy tools you rely on every day.

## A smarter *Recent activity* screen

*Recent activity* is becoming more flexible and customizable. With the upcoming filtering options, you’'ll be able to refine which network requests are displayed based on criteria such as applications, companies, event types, and statuses. This makes it easier to focus on the information that matters most and navigate large activity logs more efficiently, giving you greater control over how network activity is presented.

## Better filtering

Filtering for browser proxy and VPN extensions has also been significantly improved. Previously, traffic from these extensions had to be downgraded to HTTP/1 for filtering. AdGuard now supports full filtering over HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, providing better compatibility, more reliable protection, and a smoother browsing experience without sacrificing performance.

- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.13.1

We recently released AdGuard for Android v4.13, and now we’re following up with a quick hotfix to address a couple of bugs.

Please note that for Integration mode to work properly, you need to update both AdGuard and AdGuard VPN to their latest versions.

## 4.13

- Published: 2026-07-28T14:04:20Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.13

Please welcome the much anticipated AdGuard for Android v4.13! We set ambitious goals for this release, and did our best to deliver: a lot of work was done both in terms of big features as well as the usual behind the scenes routine of fixing bugs and oiling gears for a better performance. Let’s see the details below.

With this release, we introduced differential filter updates to AdGuard for Android! To achieve this, we integrated the FiltersListManager library into the app. Now, your filters will load automatically without consuming tons of traffic and overloading servers.

We also added post-quantum cryptography support to DnsLibs. Now AdGuard for Android, like our other full ad-blocking products, keeps your DNS requests protected against future threats.

Another significant change is our adoption of CRLite by Mozilla to verify revoked certificates. Using this instead of the more outdated OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) or letting the app check each certificate against the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) not only speeds up website loading, but also increases your privacy and safety while browsing.

To improve security in Integration mode with AdGuard VPN, we changed the connection protocol, introducing the use of credentials. With the release of AdGuard for Android v4.13, our ad blocker and VPN cooperate seamlessly and securely, with no additional action required on the user’s part for them to synchronize. No third-party apps will be able to spy on your activities, as an added bonus.

In previous versions, in-app instructions for installing HTTPS certificates were added, as the process could differ in regards to your device’s make and model. In AdGuard for Android 4.13, we added support for ColorOS (Oppo) to those instructions.

And last, but not least, we have done a lot of work on our filtering engines and fixed bugs that had accumulated over time. Scriptlets and CoreLibs were updated for better app performance.

You can consult the changelog below to see all the fixes and improvements.

## 4.12

- Published: 2025-10-01T18:40:48Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.12

With this release, using AdGuard for Android on tablets has become more convenient — thanks to everyone who voted for the landscape mode. We’ve also added the new *Share settings* feature and made improvements to CoreLibs. Read more about the new features below and don’t forget to update to version 4.12!
## Landscape mode
As we always say, your feedback is really important to us, and this time we’ve added one of the most requested features — landscape mode. Using AdGuard on a tablet is now even more convenient.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/v4.12/tablet_en.png" width="700">
</p>

Some screens still need polishing, but we’re actively working on them!

## Share settings

We’ve also added the Share settings feature. Now you don’t need to reconfigure everything on a new device or spend time describing your settings when reporting a missed ad — just share a link or scan a QR code.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/v4.12/share_en.png" width="300">
</p>

To share your settings, go to Settings → Menu (⋮) → Share settings. If someone sends you a link, just open it in a browser and tap Import.

## CoreLibs 

The new CoreLibs release includes bug fixes and various improvements. For example, userscripts now work more reliably on [SPA (Single Page Application) websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application). Check the changelog for full details.

## 4.10

- Published: 2025-06-25T17:22:52Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.10

AdGuard for Android v4.10 introduces important improvements to the HTTPS certificate installation process, making it more intuitive and accessible for users. 

When you install AdGuard and launch the app for the first time, you’re prompted to install an HTTPS certificate. This step is essential because the certificate plays a key role in ensuring effective ad filtering in browsers. Without it, filtering quality is significantly reduced. That’s why it’s crucial for all users, beginner or advanced, to be able to complete the installation without difficulty.

We knew there was room for improvement in the whole process — the previous instructions often didn’t reflect the actual settings found on devices from different manufacturers, and there was also a bug that prevented users from returning to the instructions after leaving the app.

To address these issues, we’ve added in-app guides for the most common devices — including Google Pixel, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, and OnePlus — with adjustments based on Android OS version and user locale. We’ve also fixed the bug mentioned above.

## Changelog

### Improvements
* Added HTTPS filtering by default for the Lemur browser [#5577](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/5577)

## 4.9

- Published: 2025-04-03T18:22:43Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.9

We’ve added a major feature in AdGuard v4.9 for Android: native support for userstyles. This feature has been available in AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard for Mac for a while, and now we are bringing it to AdGuard for Android!

Userstyles are similar to userscripts in a way, but they only focus on changing the appearance of websites using CSS, without getting into their code. Now customizing websites — like adding a dark theme — becomes an easy task. You can create your own userstyles in the app itself, or install ready-made styles from trusted [online sources](https://userstyles.world/).

![Wikipedia with a userstyle](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/v4.9/styled_wikipedia.jpg)

To add a userstyle, go to *Settings* → *Filtering* → *Extensions*→ *Add extension* → *Import from file or URL*. To create your own style, tap *Add extension* → *Create userstyle*.

![Install userstyle in app](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/v4.9/Userstyles_en.jpg)

Also, some users might have recently faced a bug that was increasing statistics to ridiculously huge values. We fixed the issue, and once you install AdGuard v4.9 for Android, you will see normal numbers in the *Statistics* tab. 

> Please note that statistics accumulated earlier than the last 24 hours will be heavily pruned.

Aside from this serious issue, we have also worked on fixing smaller bugs. As always, we’ve updated CoreLibs and Scriptlets for better functionality of the app.

## 4.14 Beta 1

- Published: 2026-09-03T14:29:09Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.14-beta-1

AdGuard for Android v4.14 beta 1 is focused on improving compatibility and making ad blocking work seamlessly with the privacy tools you rely on every day.

## A smarter *Recent activity* screen

*Recent activity* is becoming more flexible and customizable. With the upcoming filtering options, you'll be able to refine which network requests are displayed based on criteria such as applications, companies, event types, and statuses. This makes it easier to focus on the information that matters most and navigate large activity logs more efficiently, giving you greater control over how network activity is presented.

## Better filtering

Filtering for browser proxy and VPN extensions has also been significantly improved. Previously, traffic from these extensions had to be downgraded to HTTP/1 for filtering. AdGuard now supports full filtering over HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, providing better compatibility, more reliable protection, and a smoother browsing experience without sacrificing performance.

## Changelog

* Added a new button to export filtering log [#1327](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/1327)

* Added the *Search* field on the *Websites exclusions* screen [#5758](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/5758)
* Added a filter to *Recent activity* to hide duplicate entries [#5849](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/5849)
* Implemented smart search for the *Recent activity* screen [#4505](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/4505)

## 4.13 Beta 1

- Published: 2026-07-17T11:41:50Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.13-beta-1

If this beta of AdGuard for Android v4.13 is rolling out after a bit of radio silence, it means that sometimes the goals we set are even bigger in reality than they were in our plans. A lot of work was done across the board to get ready for the next step: the release version.

With this beta, we introduced differential filter updates to AdGuard for Android! To achieve this, we integrated the FiltersListManager library into the app. Now, your filters will load automatically without consuming tons of traffic.

We also added post-quantum cryptography support to DnsLibs. Now AdGuard for Android, like our other full ad-blocking products, keeps your DNS requests protected against future threats.

Another significant change is our: adoption of CRLite by Mozilla to verify revoked certificates. Using this instead of the more outdated OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) or letting the app check each certificate against the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) not only speeds up website loading, but also increases your privacy and safety while browsing.

And last, but not least, we have done a lot of work on our filtering engines and fixed bugs that had accumulated over time. Scriptlets and CoreLibs were updated for better app performance.

You can consult the extensive changelog below to see all the fixes and improvements.

## 4.10 Beta 1

- Published: 2025-06-17T11:54:02Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.10-beta-1

This beta introduces important improvements to the HTTPS certificate installation process, making it more intuitive and accessible for users. 

When you install AdGuard and launch the app for the first time, you’re prompted to install an HTTPS certificate. This step is essential because the certificate plays a key role in ensuring effective ad filtering in browsers. Without it, filtering quality is significantly reduced. That’s why it’s crucial for all users, beginner or advanced, to be able to complete the installation without difficulty.

We knew there was room for improvement in the whole process — the previous instructions often didn’t reflect the actual settings found on devices from different manufacturers, and there was also a bug that prevented users from returning to the instructions after switching away from the app.

To address these issues, we’ve added in-app video guides for the most common devices — including Google Pixel, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, and OnePlus — with adjustments based on Android OS version and user locale. We’ve also fixed the bug mentioned above.

## 4.7

- Published: 2024-12-03T15:41:02Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.7

Today’s version is exactly what we love: it introduces a fresh feature we couldn’t wait to see on the app. And it’s no small release – we’re introducing an in-app privacy browser to the app! Let’s take a closer look at what’s new.

> AdGuard v4.7 is the last version that supports Android 7 and 8. Starting with the next release, we will only offer support for Android 9 or higher.

## A private browser, because there’s no such thing as too much privacy

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/v4.7/agpb_en.png" width="300">
</p>

Keeping privacy in mind while browsing has become an essential part of many users’ everyday life. We want our app to be part of that routine, and that’s why we’re rolling out the AdGuard private browser, bringing an extra layer of privacy to your daily web experience.

So, what’s so cool about this browser?

* Ad and tracker blocking (of course!)
* Easy history deletion with a visible, accessible button. Also, your browser history is automatically cleared when you close the browser

To explore this new feature, tap *Try our private browser* on the app's home screen. You can also access the browser through the *Protection* tab, where you can set a default search engine and even create a browser widget.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/v4.7/agmainpb_en.png" width="300">
</p>

Just a heads-up: our private browser is still in the early stages of development and has a few limitations, like the inability to handle multiple sessions at once. In the future, we’ll offer a more comprehensive browsing experience, but for now, we suggest using it as a supplement to your usual browser’s Incognito Mode, rather than a replacement. Sounds good?

So, what’s so cool about this browser?

* Ad and tracker blocking (of course!)
* Easy history deletion with a visible, accessible button. Also, your browser history is automatically cleared when you close a tab
* The option to save a browsing session by creating a bookmark — something regular Incognito Mode doesn’t offer! If you want to pick up right where you left off without re-opening every tab or logging back in, this feature is for you. For this to work, though, we do store cookies and localStorage

To explore this new feature, tap *Try our private browser* on the app's home screen. You can also access the browser through the *Protection* tab, where you can set a default search engine and even create a browser widget.

## 4.6.4 Hotfix 

- Published: 2024-11-05T11:13:36Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.6.4-hotfix

This hotfix update resolves the battery drain issue caused by usage of java.util.Calendar in specific time zones.

## 4.6.4

- Published: 2024-10-31T15:57:15Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.6.4

If this release were a UFC fighter, it would go by the name “The Bugfixer” because it is all about squashing bugs. Let’s break down what we’ve accomplished here.

## DNS bug

We’ve tackled a particularly eye-twitching bug that caused DNS — and, as a result, the Internet — to randomly fail when switching networks. It took some detective work on our part since the issue was unpredictable and only impacted a small number of users. But hey, no one should be left without DNS protection! 

## Battery drain bug

Another irritating bug we discovered during beta testing: incorrect statistics calculations were leading to excessive battery drain. The system code was unable to calculate the date necessary for accurate statistics below a certain value. Thankfully, we’ve managed to work around this odd behavior in the system code, and now the stats are calculated correctly. They also now load faster and take up less RAM.

This issue seemed to affect users on specific versions of Android. If you were using the nightly or beta version of AdGuard and ran into this problem, we recommend updating to the stable release.

## Other fixes

A number of bug fixes and improvements come with the latest version of the CoreLibs, along with improved filtering quality — you can see the details in the changelog below.

## 4.6

- Published: 2024-07-24T16:16:20Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.6

As Vince Lombardi says, “Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.” We do as he says, and try our best to make every update better. Today we are happy to release the new version of AdGuard for Android. Faster, stronger, and more efficient. Let’s take a look at the major changes.

With the updated filtering engine CoreLibs, we have been able to implement many new features that will improve your filtering experience. First of all, we’ve increased HTTPS filtering speed. Second, there are some handy enhancements for our filter developers and advanced users. We’ve added support for [`urltransform`](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#urltransform-modifier) and [`xmlprune`](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#xmlprune-modifier) modifiers. Now even more distracting elements on a page will be blocked.

We have made some UI improvements to make our app more user friendly. Some Xiaomi users faced difficulties when trying to optimize battery usage. We thought about it and decided to add the guide.

## 4.5

- Published: 2024-06-11T12:09:19Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.5

This update brings our YouTube player’s usability to a whole new level: we added background playback, recommended videos, quality settings, and much more. Not so unskippable now, are you, ads? On top of that, this version includes some nice fixes for overall app performance, including the Android TV version.

## A ton of improvements for AdGuard’s YouTube player

Just look at what’s available now:

* Change video quality, playback speed, and subtitle settings using the gear ⚙ button

![AG player video settings](https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/jdwr7AG-player-video-settings.png)

* Picture-in-picture mode is now supported, which means you can shrink the video to a small window and keep playing it in the background while using other apps. Great for such things as listening to music or podcasts

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/x31y3AG-player-picture-in-picture.png" 
width="300" height="600">

* View recommendations at the end of the video, while paused, or by tapping the lower right corner of the player (availability depends on the video)

![AG player recommended videos](https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/g64dbAG-player-recommended.png)

* Double-tap the right or left side of the screen to skip 10 seconds forward or back correspondingly

> Quick reminder: to launch the AdGuard player, choose any video in the YouTube app, tap *Share* and select AdGuard Player (it’s likely that you will need to scroll right and tap *More* first). 
>
> Note: AdGuard player is based on the internal web browser that opens YouTube and has ad-blocking functionality built in. Therefore, the functioning and availability of its features depends on the web version of YouTube.

## 4.4

- Published: 2024-05-20T12:58:19Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.4

Improved Firewall functionality and on-the-fly DoH filtering are the highlights of AdGuard v4.4 for Android. After extensive testing, we are ready to introduce the new version to you.

## Firewall on fire

We like to think that we make the Internet cleaner and more enjoyable for users. But we are not ashamed to admit that sometimes we can send annoying notifications ourselves. Users have reported that they find using Firewall inconvenient: there are just too many notifications. As a result, people are turning them off for good in the system preferences.

In response, we have improved Firewall functionality. Now you can customize and turn off firewall notifications for all applications or specific ones. 
Don’t want to get notifications about Chrome connections? Open the notification shade, tap a notification about Chrome, and then tap *Mute*. All Firewall notifications for this app will be disabled.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/v4.4/mute.png" 
width="300" height="600">

Alternatively, you can go to *Protection* → *Firewall* → *Notifications*and toggle off notifications for individual apps.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/v4.4/settings.png" 
width="300" height="600">

## DoH requests be flying

With the updated filtering engine, CoreLibs, we can implement on-the-fly DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) connection filtering. Our [desktop apps](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-v2-14-for-mac.html) have already gone this route and it seems to work fine. Why is this feature even necessary?
 
Before, if a user enabled DoH in their browser but not in AdGuard, we had to filter requests directly in the browser and send them to the unencrypted system DNS, which decreased security. Now, with on-the-fly DoH connection filtering, we can filter DNS requests in the browser without sending them to an unencrypted server.

> You can find the new feature in *Settings* → *General* → *Advanced* → *Low-level settings* → *Filter secure DNS*.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/v4.4/dns_en.png"

We also fixed some minor bugs and updated UserscriptsWrapper and DnsLibs.

- Published: 2024-05-30T15:22:00Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.5-beta-1

This update brings our YouTube player’s usability to a whole new level. This update brings our YouTube player’s usability to a whole new level: we added background playback, recommended videos, quality settings, and much more. Not so unskippable now, are you, ads? On top of that, this version includes some nice fixes for overall app performance, including the Android TV version.

## A ton of improvements for AdGuard’s YouTube player

Just look at what’s available now:

Change video quality, playback speed, and subtitle settings using the gear ⚙ button
Picture-in-Picture mode is now supported, which means you can shrink the video to a small window and keep playing it in the background while using other apps. Great for such things as listening to music or podcasts
View recommended videos at the end of the video or by pausing the video
Double-tap the right or left side of the screen to skip 10 seconds forward or back correspondingly

> Quick reminder: to launch the AdGuard player, choose any video in the YouTube app, tap “Share” and select AdGuard Player (it’s likely that you will need to scroll right and tap “More” first).

## 4.3

- Published: 2023-12-22T12:54:19Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.3

AdGuard v4.3 for Android brings you something not only special, but unprecedented. It’s the same AdGuard you know and love, but now with a TV-sized twist – and we mean that quite literally: we’re glad to introduce the support for Android TV! Important updates and a new Developer tools section are also here to enhance your user experience with our app.

## Android TV support

![AdGuard for Android TV](https://cdn.adguard.com/content/blog/articles/androidtv_en.png)

To provide full support for Android TV, we’ve developed a version of AdGuard for Android with the most essential features to enhance your browsing experience and content filtering on your TV. The new design, fully adapted for Android TV, includes:

* Adapted onboarding
* Home screen with statistics
* Adapted Protection screen
* Adapted settings
* App management
* DNS protection

DNS protection is a key feature on AdGuard for Android TV. Securing DNS traffic through encryption adds an extra layer of security and privacy to your browsing experience. With this update, you can now benefit from this safety also on the big screen. DNS-over-HTTPS is selected by default, but you can add your own server if a different protocol is needed.

Hold on to your remote, what you are about to experience is a brand new app! You can find the detailed instructions on how to install AdGuard for Android TV [in our blog post](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-for-android-tv.html).

> Note: You’ll need a license to use AdGuard for Android TV. But you can also try it for free — we offer a 7-day trial period.

## Developer tools

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/content/blog/articles/developertools_en.jpg" 
width="300" height="600">
</p>

We invite our advanced users and filter developers who interact very actively with the app to explore our new Developer tools, a specialized section designed for quick navigation and switching between features. There you can quickly enable or disable custom filters, access logs, enable recording of different logs, and more. This feature can be enabled in *Low-level settings*.

## CoreLibs and DnsLibs updates

The recent CoreLibs v1.13 update boosts your browsing experience with improved HTML filtering, while the update of DnsLibs to v2.4 makes your connection more secure with support for HTTP basic authentication. 

## More transparency in HTTPS filtering

To enhance the transparency of HTTPS filtering, AdGuard now offers the option to inspect the original certificate via *Recent Activity*. There you can view details of any web request, examine the encryption used by AdGuard, and inspect the original certificate.

This feature stems from a major concern with HTTPS filtering. AdGuard validates the certificate (and does it well!), but there may be situations where you’d like to inspect the original certificate yourself. You can read more about this issue in our [Knowledge base](https://adguard.com/kb/general/https-filtering/known-issues/).

## 4.2

- Published: 2023-10-23T12:02:32Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.2

## AdGuard Dynamics

Get ready for a dynamic experience as AdGuard for Android makes its way to your screens with exciting new features! Now our app not only has [dynamic icons](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/4317), it also has a dynamic theme.

If you enable this option in the settings, the AdGuard app interface and icon will match the color of your smartphone interface.

> Please note that these features are only available on Android devices running version 12 or higher.

## HTTP/3 filtering support [#487](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/487)

AdGuard now not only filters HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 traffic. In this release, we have added **experimental** support for HTTP/3 filtering. The HTTP/3 protocol, powered by the QUIC network protocol, provides better privacy and security, as well as a more stable and faster Internet connection. By enabling HTTP/3 filtering, you can take advantage of the QUIC protocol and effectively block ads and trackers.

To enable HTTP/3 filtering, go to Settings → General → Advanced → Low-level settings → *Filter HTTP/3* and toggle the switch to the right.

## Support for two HTTPS certificates

By implementing two HTTPS certificates, we have fixed an issue with HTTPS filtering in Chrome 100 and above on rooted devices. While the certificate in the system store will be responsible for filtering in most apps, the certificate in the user store will allow AdGuard to filter HTTPS traffic in Chromium-based browsers. 

Installing certificates has also become easier: we’ve added step-by-step instructions.

To install the second certificate, go to Settings → Filtering → Network → HTTPS filtering → *Security сertificates* and follow the instructions.

<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/4.2/HTTP3filtering_en.png" 
width="300" height="600">
</p>

Our filters have become even more powerful and we have also fixed a bunch of bugs to ensure stable performance of the app. Hurry up to update!

- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.2-beta-1

## Dynamic icon [#4317](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/4317)

AdGuard for Android now has a dynamic icon. If you are using themed icons on your smartphone, the AdGuard app will also match the color of your system.

## HTTP/3 filtering support [#487](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/487)

AdGuard now not only filters HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 traffic. In this beta we have added experimental support for HTTP/3 filtering. The HTTP/3 protocol, powered by the QUIC network protocol, provides better privacy and security, as well as a more stable and faster Internet connection. By enabling HTTP/3 filtering, you can take advantage of the QUIC protocol and effectively block ads and trackers.

To enable HTTP/3 filtering, go to Settings → General → Advanced → Low-level settings → *Filter HTTP/3* and toggle the switch to the right.

## Support for two HTTPS certificates

By implementing two HTTPS certificates, we have fixed an issue with HTTPS filtering in Chrome version 100 and above on rooted devices. While the certificate in the system store will be responsible for filtering in most apps, the certificate in the user store will allow AdGuard to filter HTTPS traffic in Chromium-based browsers. 

Installing certificates has also become easier: we've added step-by-step instructions.

To install the second certificate, go to Settings → Filtering → Network → HTTPS filtering → *Security сertificates* and follow the instructions.

## 4.0

- Published: 2023-06-13T18:10:45Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.0

## Remarkable сhanges in AdGuard v4.0 for Android

Finally, we are ready to reveal the result of titanic efforts! Let’s take a closer look at AdGuard v4.0 for Android and talk about what has changed since version 3.6. 

### Total reengineering

We've overhauled the entire app, meticulously rewriting every line of code from the ground up. This transformative revamp has resulted in an app that's not only faster, but also smoother than ever before. 

### Complete redesign 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/assets/107266340/ca756813-86ae-428b-8302-12a37266900a" width="300" height="600">
</p>


We've reimagined the design to make the app interface simpler and bring core features to the forefront. Now, to turn on Ad blocking, Tracking protection, Annoyance blocking, or DNS protection along with their filters, you can just tap the corresponding icon above the main switch.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/assets/107266340/831280e2-06fc-4beb-b9f5-bb6ff087097a" width="300" height="600">
</p>



We've also added a separate *Protection* section. Accessible by tapping the shield icon at the bottom of the screen, this section gives you even more control. Apart from the above-mentioned “core” features, this section allows you to manage *Firewall*, *Browsing Security*, and even AdGuard VPN. From the Protection screen, you can turn these modules on or off as you wish and access their settings.

### Firewall

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/assets/107266340/55680f16-6c0f-4e0b-9c74-becd45d0966c" width="300" height="600">
</p>



We've uncovered an exciting feature from the depths of AdGuard for Android — *Firewall* – and given it a full-fledged, independent status. With it, you are the master of your domain, deciding which apps can indulge in mobile data or Wi-Fi when the screen is off. It is designed to keep you in the know with real-time notifications of app activities, so nothing escapes your attention.

And for those lightning-fast modifications, head over to the *Quick actions* section where updating firewall rules has never been simpler. With *Firewall*, you can also block apps from accessing the Internet while in roaming, saving your precious megabytes abroad.

### Detailed statistics

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/assets/107266340/8cc898c9-685b-4afe-b63c-858e56c0d910" width="300" height="1350">

A dedicated tab offers comprehensive statistics about all apps, companies, and domains. Wondering which company's requests are blocked most often? Which apps are trying to send your data and to whom? You can quickly identify and block anything suspicious.

### Integration with AdGuard VPN 

As we wrote above, Integrated mode with AdGuard VPN was introduced in AdGuard v3.5 for Android. Until then, users had to go through seven circles of hell to get our ad blocker and VPN to work simultaneously. All because normally two different network-filtering apps can’t work alongside each other on Android.

<p align="center">

</p>



With the release of AdGuard v4.0 for Android, Integrated mode has become more stable than ever. Previously, each time AdGuard or AdGuard VPN was updated or reinstalled, Integrated mode had to be reconfigured. Now, you configure it once and it will withstand updates and reinstalls while maintaining the integration. In addition, more frequent information exchange between AdGuard Ad Blocker and AdGuard VPN enhances the stability of Integrated mode without affecting performance.

> Changes in Integrated mode are synced between AdGuard v4.0 for Android and AdGuard VPN v2.3 for Android. Be sure to update both apps to the latest versions to enjoy their most stable and smooth simultaneous operation in Integrated mode. 

### Selective app proxying

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/assets/107266340/5dd58f40-a43b-4814-b62b-6e7169631e31" width="300" height="600">
</p>




Before AdGuard v4.0 for Android, you could route all of your web traffic through a specified proxy server. With the *Apps operating through proxy* feature, located at *Settings → Filtering → Network → Proxy*, you can now choose which apps will work through your proxy. In addition, *Apps operating through proxy* allows you to specify which apps will route their traffic through AdGuard VPN when operating in Integrated mode. 

### Root access perks

For all the tech enthusiasts out there, the term “root” is no stranger to you. Rooting is essentially unlocking your device to gain more privileged control. If your Android device is rooted, AdGuard v4.0 for Android offers you unprecedented capabilities beyond any previous version of AdGuard Ad Blocker.

Traditionally, AdGuard routes network traffic to its CoreLibs filtering engine by establishing a local VPN. But now, with root access, you can switch AdGuard to the *Automatic proxy* mode. Just navigate to *Settings → Filtering → Network → Routing mode* and switch to *Automatic proxy*. This action takes local VPN out of the picture and instead configures iptables to accomplish the same goals. And there are several benefits to this change.

Firstly, AdGuard is now able to apply DNS filtering to IPv6 requests, something that was not possible before. Secondly, we've ironed out a few issues that hampered AdGuard from accurately associating web requests with their respective apps. This fine-tuning will enhance the performance of Firewall, Filtering log, and so forth. For those of you with rooted devices, this AdGuard update takes your control and customization to a whole new level!

### Low-level settings rework

Diving into the realm of Low-level settings? Found under Settings → General → Advanced, these options are designed with the tech-savvy user in mind. It's a powerful playground, but it's also a place where it's all too easy to mess things up if you're not careful. Despite all the warnings we’ve placed, it's human nature to explore and experiment, often without fully understanding the consequences.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/assets/107266340/723ce5f2-a8f5-474b-962d-67b82d552045" width="300" height="600">
</p>



In response to this, we've made the Low-level settings more user-friendly and intuitive. It's now easier to understand what each setting does, and even if you do make a mistake, we've implemented security measures like validation checks for entered values to protect you from major missteps.

As for the settings themselves, we've added new ones, retired old ones, and have continued to refine this advanced toolset. A [comprehensive guide on Low-level settings is available in our Knowledge base](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-android/solving-problems/low-level-settings/). So get ready for an enhanced, yet safer deep dive into the depths of customization with AdGuard's advanced settings!

## 4.0 beta 1

- Published: 2023-04-24T15:04:42Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.0-beta-1

Remember when we talked about [the first Nightly of AdGuard v4.0 for Android](https://adguard.com/blog/adguard-v4-0-for-android-nightly.html)? It was the first version after a long break — with reworked design and texts, rewritten code, and new features.

Thanks to our development, QA, design, and content teams, we’re releasing the first beta version: refreshed, significantly more stable, and available in multiple languages.

Since the release of the first Nightly version, we’ve fixed more than 100 bugs! Though, it doesn't mean there are no more left (known issues are gathered on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Version%3A+AdGuard+v4.0%22+-label%3A%22Status%3A+Resolved%22)). If you encounter any, please let us know. Instructions on how to report bugs are below.
## First Nightly updates

If you haven't read the post about Nightly, [take a look](https://adguard.com/blog/adguard-v4-0-for-android-nightly.html). We wrote a lot about the changes compared to v3.6, the last AdGuard version before v4.0. There’s something useful for those who are not very tech-savvy, as well as for those who understand the details and are willing to dig even into low-level settings.

Here’s a brief overview of the improvements:

  * **Complete redesign**. We made the design lighter, more minimalist, and easier to understand, and put the most important features on a separate screen — now it will be much easier to access them.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/protection_en.jpg?0" width="300" height="600">
</p>

  * **Firewall**. Now you can control the access to the Internet for all your apps — if you wish, prevent them from using the Internet without your knowledge.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/firewall_en.jpg" width="300" height="600">
</p>


  * **Statistics**. Now you can view detailed stats for apps, companies, and domains. Complete transparency!

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/statistics_en.jpg?0" width="300" height="600">
</p>


  * **Integration with AdGuard VPN**. We’ve greatly enhanced the stability of the Integrated mode.
  * **Selective app proxying**. Now you can exclude apps from your proxy — even from AdGuard VPN!
  * **Root access perks**. On rooted devices, among other things, you can now apply DNS filtering to IPv6 requests — thanks to the *Automatic proxy* mode.
  * **Easier-to-understand low-level settings**. We’ve updated the design and added clear descriptions as well as input validation so you can be sure that everything is working as it should.

## What’s changed since the first Nightly
### Support for multiple languages

Now the app supports more than 15 languages. But we know there’s much to be improved. If you notice that some translations are missing or if the app is not translated into your language, we’ll be thankful for your contributions on Crowdin. Read more about how to translate AdGuard products in our [Knowledge base](https://adguard.com/kb/miscellaneous/contribute/translate/program/).
### Firewall roaming support

Although this feature was already in the first Nightly version, it didn’t actually work — a truly nightly experience. But now you can block access to the Internet for specific apps when roaming. Megabytes, especially valuable when you're traveling abroad, won't be wasted.
### Import and export of user rules, blocklists, and allowlists

In the first Nightly, you could only import settings as a whole. Now you can import user rules separately. It’s useful if you want to share your rules with someone or transfer them to your other AdGuard apps.

## How to download beta

Visit the [beta page](https://adguard.com/beta.html?platform=android), download the APK file of the beta version, and install it. Done! You’re ready to start exploring.

![How to get the beta version](https://cdn.adtidy.org/content/release_notes/ad_blocker/android/beta_en.png)

Alternatively, you can choose the beta channel right in the app. If you’ve used the Nightly channel, go to *Settings* → *General* → *App and filer updates* and switch to Beta.

If you’re using the Release channel, open Settings* → *General* → *Updates* → *Update channel* and select *Beta*.

> To switch back to the Release channel, you’ll need to reinstall the app.

## Report bugs and vote for feature requests

We’ve already talked about that earlier, so here’s a quick reminder:

1. Check out the [Android repo](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardforAndroid/issues) to make sure the issue hasn’t been reported yet.
2. If the issue is new, open the [page for creating new issues](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/new/choose) and select *Bug report*.
3. [Describe the problem](https://adguard.com/kb/guides/report-bugs/#how-to-describe-a-problem). If possible, attach screenshots or a screen recording.

If you want to support the implementation of a new feature or bugfix, you can vote for it on GitHub. To vote, just react with some emoji.

> If you use AdGuard VPN and Ad Blocker in the Integrated mode, download the [beta version of AdGuard VPN](https://adguard-vpn.net/beta.html?platform=android&release=beta).

## In conclusion

We're one step closer to the release we hope you'll enjoy. We would like to thank all the beta testers and translators for their dedication — with your help, bugs get fixed and the app gets better.

## 4.0 Nightly 39

- Published: 2023-01-30T16:59:40Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v4.0-nightly-39

We haven't talked about AdGuard's mobile apps for a long time, but now we're ready to let you in on what we've been up to.

The Android app has been improved so that everyone can enjoy its perks. It is now much simpler to use for people without any technical background and more packed with features for those who want complete control over their data.

Moreover, we've completely rewritten the app so that it runs way faster and smoother.

> Disclaimer: this is a Nightly version — so the app contains more bugs than usual (here's the [list of known issues](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Version%3A+AdGuard+v4.0%22+-label%3A%22Status%3A+Resolved%22)). If you're not ready to report bugs, better not take the risk and wait for the release — we're actively working on making the app more stable.

## Updates useful for everyone

### Full redesign

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/iqfm6main.jpg" width="300" height="650">
</p>

Originally, AdGuard for Android has a plethora of features — it serves as an all-purpose tool for blocking ads, trackers, and other threats. While redesigning it, we tried to simplify access to the "core" features, so that all of them are available with a single tap. Now, to turn on Ad blocking, Tracking protection, Annoyance blocking, or DNS protection along with their filters, you can just tap the corresponding icon above the main switch.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/la0mnprotection.jpg" width="300" height="650">
</p>

We've also added the *Protection* section. You can find it by tapping the shield icon at the bottom of the screen. Apart from the above-mentioned "core" features, this section allows you to manage Firewall, Browsing security, and even AdGuard VPN. On the Protection screen, you may turn these modules on or off as well as easily access their settings.

### Detailed statistics

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/qv07vstatistics.jpg" width="300" height="1200">
</p>

This is not news that apps nowadays do whatever they want with your data and leak it all over the place. And it's quite logical that the user wants complete control over their data. With AdGuard, it's already possible — and now we're introducing a feature that would provide even more transparency! Which apps and companies would potentially leak your data?
With Statistics, you'll now be able to track which apps send your data to global corporations — and block or allow some requests on the fly.

### Firewall

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.adtidy.org/blog/new/40jm3firewall.jpg" width="300" height="650">
</p>

The Android app used to have a functionality similar to Firewall earlier, but it was hidden deep inside the app — in the App management section. Now it's become a completely standalone feature with well-defined scope of actions.

Firewall allows you to control the apps' access to the Internet: decide which apps can use mobile data or Wi-Fi with screen off, get real-time notifications on app activity, and update firewall rules in the Quick actions section.

> The Nightly version is filled to the brim with new features, and this is just the beginning. If you are curious to learn more, read the [blog post](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-v4-0-for-android-nightly.html) — there we cover the advanced features in detail and share our plans for the future. 

## Test it yourself

We need your feedback! [Download](https://agrd.io/android_nightly) the Nightly version of AdGuard v4.0 for Android and (if you're using AdGuard VPN) the [Nightly version of AdGuard VPN](https://adguard-vpn.com/en/beta.html?platform=android&release=nightly), report issues, and send feature requests. Here's the info you might need.

### How to report an issue

If you've noticed a bug, please tell us about it by creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/new/choose). Describe what you've found and share your logs with devteam@adguard.com — this'll make it easier for us to address the problem.

On [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Feature+request%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc), you can leave your reactions on feature requests. That'll help us find out what most people are interested in. To leave your reaction, select the feature request you like and use an emoji to support its implementation.

## In conclusion

We've never devoted this much attention to a single nightly version — and for a reason. They are usually of interest only to a small number of die-hard enthusiasts. But this time is different. This version heralds huge changes that will soon come to AdGuard Ad Blocker for Android for a lot of people, and we want to do it right.

With your help, the help of the community, we will be able to track down every single bug and tweak all the knobs just right, so that once the update ships to release, millions of AdGuard users will find it perfect.

## 3.6.11

- Published: 2023-01-23T13:18:23Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v3.6.11

>Disclaimer AdGuard for Android is not an open-source project. We use Github as an open bug tracker for users to see what developers are working on.

You must have been missing AdGuard for Android updates. Well, you won't be bored now, because we're breaking into 2023 with a new release of the product, and we'll only gain traction from there. 

The main changes in AdGuard v3.6.11 for Android were made in our core filtering engine – CoreLibs and DNSLibs. As for the rest, we’ve worked to enhance content filtering and made a bunch of minor changes to improve the application performance. 

## Updated DnsLibs to v2.0.75 [#4324](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/4324)

A significantly updated version of the DNS filtering library consumes less resources and runs faster. The DNS-over-QUIC protocol implementation now supports the [RFC 9250](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9250/) standard, and the experimental status was removed from the DoQ support.

### First step to Encrypted ClientHello support [DL#161](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/DnsLibs/issues/161)

First of all, what is Encrypted ClientHello? Nowadays, almost every internet connection is encrypted and no one can see what's inside this encrypted connection. However, there is still one little issue with it: the very first packet of the connection indicates the name of the server you are connecting to. Say you want to open `www.google.com`, your ISP cannot see what exactly you send and receive from it, but they know what website you are communicating with. ECH (Encrypted ClientHello) is a new technology that is supposed to solve this issue and encrypt that last bit of unencrypted information.

So what would be the first step to supporting it from AdGuard? Surprisingly, it is to suppress ECH! This can be done by switching on both `pref.dns.block.ech` and `pref.https.redirect.doh` flags in the *Low-level settings*.

But fret not: what we want to achieve is to provide you with ECH support globally so that **all** your apps could benefit from ECH, not just your browser. To accomplish this, AdGuard makes your apps establish regular HTTPS connections with it, and then it will establish a ECH-enabled connection on their behalf. This experimental feature is planned for the next update so stay tuned.

## Updated CoreLibs to v1.10.186

### DNS-over-HTTPS filtering

**Added an option to redirect secure DNS requests to the local DNS proxy [#1563](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1563)**

Chrome and Firefox DNS queries sometimes could circumvent DNS filtering by using a DNS-over-HTTPS server. Now AdGuard can automatically filter DNS-over-HTTPS as well.

This feature is experimental and can be enabled in *Low-level settings*, its name is `pref.https.redirect.doh`. In the future versions we're planning to enable it by default.

### Improved content filtering

The following new features are important to filter maintainers and provide advanced capabilities for content filtering. 

#### Enhancement

* Added a new [`$jsonprune` basic rule modifier](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#jsonprune-modifier). This modifier allows advanced filtering for JSON responses [#1447](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1447)
* Added a new [`$hls` basic rule modifier](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/#hls-modifier). This modifier provides advanced filtering capabilities for modifying HTTP live streaming files which will help with preventing video ads. [#1434](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1434)
* Expanded capabilities of the `$stealth` modifier. Filters maintainers can now specify which Stealth Mode features should be disabled for a given URL. Before that change the only option was to completely disable Stealth Mode. [#1224](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1224)
* Added support for empty `$path` modifier for non-basic rules. [#1591](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1591)
* `$removeparam` can now be applied to POST requests. [#1573](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1573)

#### Fixed

* *Hide your Referrer from third-parties* Stealth mode option interferes with the `$third-party` modifier [#1640](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1640)
* Cosmetic rules with `:where()` pseudo-class are rejected [#1609](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1609)
* Rules with `$third-party` modifier block resources from the site's own subdomain [#1637](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1637)
* Rules with the `$all` modifier do not block explicitly visited sites [#1590](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1590)

## Other improvements

* Enabled HTTPS filtering by default for Soul Browser [#4202](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/4202)

## Other fixes

* When confirming 2FA the code entry page disappears in some cases
* AdGuard does not create a local VPN and protection does not start [#4269](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/4269)
* Internet fails to work when a network is changing from Wi-Fi to mobile data [#4265](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/4265)
* Compatibility issue with iRobot Home app [#4273](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/4273)

## 3.6.11 beta 1

- Published: 2023-01-13T17:12:36Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v3.6.11-beta-1

>Disclaimer AdGuard for Android is not an open-source project. We use Github as an open bug tracker for users to see what developers are working on.

You must have been missing AdGuard for Android updates. Well, you won't be bored now, because we're breaking into 2023 with a new beta version of the product, and we'll only gain traction from there. 

The main changes in AdGuard v3.6.11 for Android beta were made in our core filtering engine – CoreLibs and DNSLibs. As for the rest, we’ve worked to enhance content filtering and made a bunch of minor changes to improve the application performance. 

## Updated DnsLibs to v2.0.66

A significantly updated version of the DNS filtering library consumes less resources and runs faster. The DNS-over-QUIC protocol implementation now supports the [RFC 9250](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9250/) standard, and the experimental status was removed from the DoQ support.

### First step to Encrypted ClientHello support [DL#161](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/DnsLibs/issues/161)

First of all, what is Encrypted ClientHello? Nowadays, almost every internet connection is encrypted and no one can see what's inside this encrypted connection.

So what would be the first step to supporting it from AdGuard? Surprisingly, it is to suppress it! This can be done by switching both `pref.dns.block.ech` and `pref.https.redirect.doh` flags in the *Low Level Settings*.

📲  Lately some of our users experienced discomfort — they couldn’t make voice calls in WhatsApp when AdGuard v3.6.6 for Android is enabled. The CoreLibs team managed to combat this problem.
:books: Besides, we’ve made several fixes to [the scriptlets library](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/Scriptlets). To recap, scriptlets are powerful blocking tools. In particular, they carry out a noble mission: to neutralize anti ad blockers. The previous version of AdGuard for Android had a scriptlet library that contained an incorrect fix for rules like `#%#/scriptlet(“abort-current-inline-script”, ...)`, which could break some web pages; now the problem is solved.
Having dealt with all the issues, we’re ready to present a new version. Please meet v3.6.7, we’ve done our best for it to function smoothly. 

### Changelog

* [Fixed] AdGuard breaks calls in WhatsApp [#4080](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/4080)

> **Disclaimer** AdGuard for Android is not an open-source project. We use Github as an open bug tracker for users to see what developers are working on.

In this version we focused on updating CoreLibs. Namely, we dealt with the priority of existing modifiers and added several new ones: `$denyallow`, `$redirect-rule`, `$removeheader`, and `$specifichide`. It might be of interest to users who’d like to [create their own ad filters](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters). Besides, we’ve made userscript exclusions work properly and fixed all issues found.
We know you are waiting for v4.0, so are we. Trust us, it’s worth it.

## 3.6.2

- Published: 2021-05-13T14:29:46Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v3.6.2

> **Disclaimer** AdGuard for Android is not an open-source project. We use Github as an open bug tracker for users to see what developers are working on.

Well, well, 3.6.2 release arrived. One beta and two RCs have proved successful, we said, “Hooray,” and released the final version right away.

So, what’s inside it? We could write about updated CoreLibs and DnsLibs, improved data collection for reports and minor issues like parsing SDNS links for DoQ servers, but honestly, not many people would understand what the hell it means. Trust us, the app has only gotten better!

P.S. v4.0 is coming. Hopefully, v3.6.2 will be the last way station before the new era.

## 3.6

- Published: 2020-12-15T10:43:20Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v3.6

> **Disclaimer** AdGuard for Android is not an open-source project. We use Github as an open bug tracker for users to see what developers are working on.

AdGuard for Android v3.6 is headlined by two pretty big changes, new features even. It's watching YouTube ad-free inside the app and DNS-over-QUIC protocol support. The first one is easy to grasp, the second one will take some explaining. 
​

**[Enhancement] An option to watch Youtube ad-free [#2994](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/2994)**
​
Blocking ads in YouTube on Android has been exclusive to browsers for a long time, thanks to the restrictions Android OS imposes on filtering other apps' traffic. However, we found a way for you to avoid ads in YouTube app. Follow these easy steps:
​
<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/Blog/Android/3-6/share.gif" style="border: 1px solid #efefef; max-height: 700px; max-width: 350px; padding: 2px;">
​
1. Open the YouTube app and start the video you want to watch.
2. Tap on the Share button and select AdGuard for Android from the list of apps.
3. A new window will pop up where you'll be able to watch the video without being interrupted by ads! 
​

**[Enhancement] DNS-over-QUIC support**
​
DNS-over-QUIC, or simply DoQ, is a DNS encryption protocol. You might have heard about DNS encryption protocols before, the most common ones are DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS (DoH and DoT correspondingly). So what makes DoQ so special? A bunch of things, really: out-of-the-box encryption, reduced connection times, and better performance in cases of lost data packets.
​
<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/Blog/Android/3-6/DNS-over-QUIC_en.png" width="300">
​
The feature is still experimental — AdGuard for Android is one of the first open-source implementations of DNS-over-QUIC — but it's perfectly functioning and we encourage you to try it. You'll find it under *DNS Filtering*. Select AdGuard DNS and choose DoQ from among the available encryption protocols.
​
### Changelog

* [Enhanced] HTTPS filtering for the Firefox Fenix browser is enabled forcibly [#3617](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/3617)
* [Enhanced] The "What's new" dialog is updated [#3638](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/3638) 
* [Fixed] Shadowsocks proxy gets removed automatically [#3641](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/3641) 
​
#### DnsLibs updated to v1.4.14

* [Enhanced] DoQ/DoH/DoT queries are retried before using the fallback [#86](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/DnsLibs/issues/86) 
* [Other] DoQ support is added to DNS stamps [#84](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/DnsLibs/issues/84)

Today we are launching a small but still very important hotfix. Namely, the compatibility with the new Chrome 87 was improved and the CoreLibs was updated.

**[Other] ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR on some websites #1374**

This week Chrome 87 was released, which has a compatibility problem with AdGuard when using the HTTP/2 filtering protocol - some sites may experience regular hangs and download errors. In this update we have improved HTTP/2 filtering compatibility with Chrome 87, it is recommended to upgrade to the new stable version as soon as possible. :)

### Changelog

## 3.5 

- Published: 2020-09-08T13:12:00Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v3.5

It's time to release AdGuard v3.5 for Android. We took our time with this one: tested two betas and expanded the changelog. What's in there? Introduced compatibility mode with AdGuard VPN for Android, updated CoreLibs and a load-truck of fixed bugs.

**[Enhancement] Compatibility Mode with AdGuard VPN for Android app #3441**

Since AdGuard VPN for Android was first introduced, there was already a way to make it work along with AdGuard ad blocker. But to make the two apps coexist in peace, you were required to jump through some hoops. Anyone who went ahead and did the thing 100% has been waiting for a proper integration ever since — and we oblige.

The best kind of compatibility is when you install two apps and they just start working together. We did exactly that. Presuming you already have AdGuard ad blocker installed, just download AdGuard VPN from Google Play Store (you can get there right from the ad blocker app, there's a new item in General Settings menu).

<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/Release_notes/Android/v3.5/settings.gif" width="300">

Both apps will detect each other and do everything that's needed for smooth joint work. All that will be left for you is to enjoy both ad-free Internet and all the benefits of a VPN. By the way, it works the other way around just as well: install AdGuard ad blocker on top of an already-running AdGuard VPN and you're good.

<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/Release_notes/Android/v3.5/compatibility.gif" width="300">

If you'd like to disable Compatibility Mode for any reason, it's very simple to do so from AdGuard ad blocker settings, just toggle the switch. Additionally, you can add AdGuard ad blocker and AdGuard VPN tiles to your device's notification bar and toggle them in one tap at your own will — thanks to Compatibility Mode the configuration will change immediately and silently.

- Published: 2020-04-03T10:45:22Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v3.3.231

Yet another and hopefully the last fix before the fresh beta rolls out. Several domains have been added to SSL exceptions to fix compatibility issues with certain mobile carriers.

* [Changed] The list of HTTPS exclusions has been updated

## 3.4 Release

- Published: 2020-05-21T11:21:25Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v3.4-release

Meet AdGuard v3.4 for Android, it’s time for it to see the world! Having tested two betas, we feel confident to present this version to a wider audience. Spring is a time for renewal, and software is not an exception. We've fixed some old bugs, updated CoreLibs and made the app more compatible with Android TV.

**[Fixed] AdGuard blocks Internet connection #2842**

This bug was a hard nut to crack. For a long time it appeared randomly (at least, it seemed so) on devices of AdGuard users. Still, the symptoms matched: smartphones lost any network completely while AdGuard was turned on. Of course, it was crucial for us to solve this problem, and at last, we've managed to do it. It’s beyond words how relieved we feel afterwards, let alone the affected users!

**[Fixed] Firewall's restrictions are ignored when WiFi gets enabled #3313**

Another troublesome bug that deserves special attention. In the previous version 3.3, if you had specifically prohibited some apps from accessing the Internet via mobile data, the restrictions worked right up until you enabled Wi-Fi, which was not the intended behaviour.

**[Enhancement] Integration with DnsLibs #3229**

DnsLibs is a DNS proxy library that's required to provide DNS filtering. It supports all existing DNS protocols including DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, and DNSCrypt. We developed it to replace the old DNSproxy, which had one serious flaw: it caused high battery resource consumption. DnsLibs is much better optimized and will ensure a longer lifespan for your phone's battery if you're using DNS filtering a lot.

**[Enhancement] Improved functionality on Android TV #3238**

AdGuard for Android is first and foremost an app for mobile phones and tablets, but it can be installed on other Android devices, such as smart TVs. We have made several improvements for this specific case, for example:

- AdGuard now better works with lists
- Better navigation between AG menus on smart TVs
- Option to click on snackbars
- Option to exit the promo screen
- "Close" option for all dialogues

Now AdGuard for Android will be much easier in use if you decide to install it on your smart TV. If you still encounter any bugs or inconsistent behaviour, please report it here.

- Published: 2020-11-20T18:04:23Z

> **Disclaimer** AdGuard for Android is not an open-source project. We use Github as an open bug tracker for users to see what developers are working on.

Today we are launching a small but still very important beta. Namely, the compatibility with the new Chrome 87 was improved and the CoreLibs was updated.

**[Other] ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR on some websites [#1374](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/1374)**

This week Chrome 87 was released, which has a compatibility problem with AdGuard when using the HTTP/2 filtering protocol - some sites may experience regular hangs and download errors. In this update we have improved HTTP/2 filtering compatibility with Chrome 87, it is recommended to upgrade to the new stable version as soon as possible. :)

Today we release the first beta version of AdGuard v3.5 for Android. It features a long list of various impovements in its changelog, but the main focus is, without a doubt, on the freshly introduced compatibility mode with AdGuard VPN for Android.

**[Enhancement] Compatibility Mode with AdGuard VPN Android app [#3441](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/3441)**

## 3.4 beta 1

- Published: 2020-04-27T11:49:40Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v3.4-beta-1

Please welcome the first beta version of AdGuard v3.4 for Android! To start things off, we've enhanced the app in a few directions, including fixing some of the oldest known bugs and improving Android TV compatibility. 

**[Bug] AdGuard blocks Internet connection [#2842](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/2842)**

This bug had been puzzling us for a very long time. It appeared on various devices of AdGuard users and was seemingly random. However, the symptoms were the same: the smartphone lost any network completely while AdGuard was turned on. Needless to say, it had been our top priority to fix this issue, and finally, we've managed to beat it. Not going to lie, it's a big relief not only for the affected users but for us too!

**[Enhancement] Integration with DnsLibs [#3229](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/3229)**

[DnsLibs](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/DnsLibs) is a DNS proxy library that's required to provide DNS filtering. It supports all existing DNS protocols including DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, and DNSCrypt. We developed it to replace the old DNSproxy, which had one serious flow: it caused high battery resource consumption. DnsLibs is much better optimized and will ensure a longer lifespan for your phone's battery if you're using DNS filtering a lot. 

**[Enhancement] Improved functionality on Android TV [#3238](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/3238)**

AdGuard for Android is first and foremost an app for mobile phones and tablets, but it can be installed on other Android devices, such as smart TVs. We have made several improvements for this specific case, for example:

- AdGuard now better works with lists
- Better navigation between AG menus on smart TVs
- Option to click on snackbars
- Option to exit the promo screen
- "Close" option for all dialogues

Now AdGuard for Android will be much easier in use if you decide to install it on your smart TV. If you still encounter any bugs or inconsistent behavior, please report it [here](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/new/choose).  

**[Bug] Firewall's restriction are ignored when WiFi gets enabled [#3313](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/3313)**

And another unpleasant bug that deserves a special mention. In v3.3, if you had specifically prohibited some apps from accessing the Internet via mobile data, the restrictions worked right up until you enabled WiFi, which was not the intended behaviour.

## Changelog

## 3.3.2 Release

- Published: 2020-02-13T16:26:35Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v3.3.230

In this small update, there’s only one but important fix and a few additions to the exclusions list.

* [Fixed] Protection doesn’t restart when an excluded app is installed #3340
* [Changed] The list of HTTPS exclusions has been updated

## 3.3.1 Release

- Published: 2019-12-30T11:11:34Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v3.3.229

Recently we claimed to make the last release of the year, and it kinda was that. Ignore that this update is called a 'release', it's more of a 'hotfix'. Because you wouldn't call this tiny hotfix a release, right? Just a couple of bugsfixes, that's all.

- [Fixed] The protection doesn't start autimatically if you restart the phone right after checking for filter updates #3286
- [Fixed] Stealth Mode configuration isn't saved after app update #3287

## 3.3 Release

- Published: 2019-12-26T13:21:38Z
- Release: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/releases/tag/v3.3.228

The last AdGuard for Android release of the decade! This sounds solid. Anyway, it’s more of a coincidence than anything else that such a massive update falls right on Christmas. And don’t get us wrong: it is massive. Multiple major features and over 50 lesser ones — all in all it combines to make a nice Christmas gift for y’all!

**[Improved] Filtering engine**

Version 3.3 brings scriptlets and `$redirect` modifiers support. Scriptlets is a powerful ad-blocking tool that helps to block ads on websites that use different circumvention techniques. `$redirect` modifier is another tool that allows substituting an ad with special ‘resources’ instead of blocking it. For instance, it can replace a banner with a transparent 1x1 image.

**[Changed] The onboarding process #2895**

We sure love us some redesign! This time, we revamped the onboarding sequence (basically, what you see when you launch the app for the first time). Key changes:

- An option to choose a ‘quick’ or a ‘long’ configuration: you’ll be asked to either make only key decisions or set most of the settings manually
- New option to allow sending some technical and interaction information that will help us further improve AdGuard
- Better graphics!

**[Added] New activation flow #2901**

Not a lot of Android users had a chance to see our AdGuard for iOS app, so they likely don’t know about the system that’s being used there for Premium features activation. But it recommended itself as one that’s convenient for users, so we adopted it for AdGuard for Android too.

<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/screenshots/android/activation_En_account.png?123" width="300"> <img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/screenshots/android/activation_en_license.png" width="300">

As you can see, there are now two options: enter a license key directly, or log into AdGuard personal account. If your account has a license key that can be used to activate Premium, it will get picked up automatically after you enter credentials.
