## Required verification before converter changes

1. Confirm behavior in official AdGuard filtering documentation, CoreLibs/Scriptlets source, or a linked upstream issue.
2. Add positive, negative, and false-positive regression tests.
3. Update `config/adguard-converter-capabilities.json` in a reviewed pull request.
4. Rebuild generated filters and run AGLint plus unit tests.
